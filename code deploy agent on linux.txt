To install the CodeDeploy agent on an Amazon EC2 instance running Amazon Linux, follow these steps:

1. **Connect to your EC2 instance**:
   Use SSH to connect to your instance. Replace `your-key.pem` with your key file and `ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns` with your instance's public DNS.

   ```bash
   ssh -i your-key.pem ec2-user@your-instance-public-dns
   ```

2. **Update the package repository**:
   Update the package repository to ensure you have the latest package information.

   ```bash
   sudo yum update -y
   ```

3. **Install the CodeDeploy agent**:
   You can install the CodeDeploy agent by using the following commands:

   ```bash
   sudo yum install -y ruby wget
   ```

   Then, download and install the CodeDeploy agent:

   ```bash
   cd /tmp
   wget https://aws-codedeploy-us-west-2.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com/latest/install
   chmod +x ./install
   sudo ./install auto
   ```

   *(Make sure to replace the URL with the correct region if you're not using `us-west-2`.)*

4. **Start the CodeDeploy agent**:
   Start the CodeDeploy agent with the following command:

   ```bash
   sudo service codedeploy-agent start
   ```

5. **Enable the CodeDeploy agent to start on boot**:
   To ensure the CodeDeploy agent starts on system boot, run:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl enable codedeploy-agent
   ```

6. **Check the status of the CodeDeploy agent**:
   You can verify that the agent is running by checking its status:

   ```bash
   sudo service codedeploy-agent status
   ```

7. **Firewall settings (if applicable)**:
   Ensure that your instance's security group allows outbound access to the internet, as the CodeDeploy agent needs to communicate with the AWS CodeDeploy service.

After completing these steps, your CodeDeploy agent should be up and running on your EC2 instance! If you encounter any issues, feel free to ask for help.
